"Demo":http://www.philwareham.co.uk/

This project is the source for the default theme that ships as standard with "Textpattern CMS":http://textpattern.com as of v4.6.0 onwards. It is intended as a starting point for new users learning the Textpattern CMS for the first time or existing users that want to adapt their current code for modern standards, and is not intended as a finished production theme (though you could use it as such if you want to).

h2. Requirements

Building this source repository requires:

* "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/ >=0.10.0
* "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ ~0.4.0

h2. Setup

h3. Installing required tools

The project uses "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ to run tasks and "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ for CSS pre-processing. First make sure you have base dependencies installed: "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/ and "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/. You can install Node using the "installer":https://nodejs.org and Grunt with npm:

bc. $ npm install -g grunt-cli

Consult the Grunt documentation for more instructions if necessary. You might need to use @sudo npm install -g grunt-cli@ instead when installing on certain Unix-based systems.

h3. Installing dependencies

After you have the base dependencies taken care of, you can install the project's dependencies. Navigate to the project's directory, and run the dependency managers:

bc. $ cd textpattern-default-theme
$ npm install

*npm* installs Node modules for Grunt. You might need to use @sudo npm install@ instead when installing on certain Unix-based systems.

h2. Building

This repository hosts sources and needs to be built before it can be used. After you have installed all dependencies, you will be able to run tasks using Grunt, including building:

bc. $ grunt [task]

Where the @[task]@ is either @build@ or @watch@.

* The @build@ task builds the project.
* The @watch@ task will launch a task that watches for file changes; the project is then automatically built if a source file is modified.

h3. Design patterns Textile/HTML reference page

bc. /design-patterns-page.textile

This is a reference file you can use when authoring themes, it contains many of the HTML5 tags (and their equivalent Textile format where available) that should be accounted for in your designs. Paste this code directly into a Textpattern article (*please note* that some HTML5 tags may not be fully supported by all browsers).
