h2. Extra code option: flickr

h4. /extra-options-non-core/flickr/flickr.css

CSS code specific to the Flickr feed. If you using Sass then refer to the file below instead. Paste this in just before the end of the @media screen section of the stylesheet (i.e. the section before the size specific media queries begin).

h4. /extra-options-non-core/flickr/flickr.scss

Sass version of the above CSS file - if you are using Sass to author your CSS then paste this code into the @default.scss@ instead of into the standard CSS file. Paste this in just before the end of the @media screen section of the stylesheet (i.e. the section before the size specific media queries begin).

h4. /extra-options-non-core/flickr/flickr.txp

Either paste this file into page templates before the end of the @role="complementary"@ sidebar. Or put a @<txp:output_form form="flickr" />@ tag in your page templates @role="complementary"@ sidebar instead, create a new form in the system with name of 'flickr' and type of 'misc', then copy/paste the code from this form into it.

Remember to change the text @your_flickr_badge_id@ to your actual "Flickr ID":http://www.adamwlewis.com/articles/what-is-my-flickr-id and @your_flickr_url@ to your actual Flickr URL.

h2. Extra code option: footer_copyright

h4. /extra-options-non-core/footer_copyright/footer.txp

Add dynamically updated copyright statement to your page footers. Paste the code into your current page templates, replacing the previous footer code. Note this code requires that you have 'Allow PHP in pages?' set to 'yes' in the Textpattern advanced preferences.

h2. Extra code option: google_plus

h4. /extra-options-non-core/google_plus/google_plus1.txp

Add a Google +1 button to each of your articles. Paste the code from that form your default.article.txp form (around line 24 is recommended). Note that we are loading this as asynchronous JavaScript so it does not delay page rendering.

h2. Extra code option: jquery

h4. /extra-options-non-core/jquery/jquery.txp

You can either paste the contents of this form directly into your page templates or put a @<txp:output_form form="jquery" />@ tag in your page templates instead, create a new form in the system with name of 'jquery' and type of 'misc', then copy/paste the code from this form into it. Note that preferred link is via Google's CDN hosted copy of jQuery, with a fallback to the locally hosted copy if the CDN is unavailable.

bc. <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="<txp:site_url />js/libs/jquery.js"><\/script>')</script>

The advantages of using the CDN version over your own hosted copy is threefold - one, it saves bandwidth on your own server; two, Google's servers are extremely low latency and high bandwidth; three, there is a fair chance an end user will already have a copy of Google's CDN jQuery already cached in their browser if they have been to another site that has also used this method to provide jQuery, that means they will not have to reload it and ultimately makes your site render quicker - bonus points!

h4. /extra-options-non-core/jquery/js/jquery.js

The ubiquitous "jQuery":http://jquery.com/ JavaScript library is used on thousands of sites worldwide. Place this file into your root /js/ directory.

h2. Extra code option: page_title

h4. /extra-options-non-core/page_title/page_title.misc.txp

Use this form in your site to provide more context focused page titles, it sets up a variable to check what section you are in and provide specific title content. Based on an example by Els Lepelaars. Create a new form in the system with name of 'page_title' and type of 'misc', then copy/paste the code from this file into it. This form can then be called from your page/form templates by inserting @<txp:output_form form="page_title" />@ into the @<head>@ section.
